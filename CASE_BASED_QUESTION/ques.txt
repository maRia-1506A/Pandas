You are given two Pandas DataFrames:
    1. Customer Profile DataFrame
        This contains basic customer information such as CustomerID, Name, and City.

    2. Transaction History DataFrame
        This contains customer transaction details such as CustomerID, TransactionID, and Amount.

Your Goals:
    1. Merge both DataFrames using the CustomerID column so that each customer’s profile is combined with their transaction history.

    2. Create a new customer record (a new DataFrame row).

    3. Concatenate this new customer record with the merged DataFrame.

    4. Save the final DataFrame to a CSV file.
